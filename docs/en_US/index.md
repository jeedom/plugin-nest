The Nest plugin allows you to control the Nest thermostat and retrieve
Nest Protect information.

> **IMPORTANT**
>
>There is no API for Nest E in Europe. This plugin therefore does not allow you to control a Nest E thermostat in Europe.

> **IMPORTANT**
>
> There is no real-time feedback (just synchronization every 15 min), so this plugin cannot be used to have a real-time fire alarm (nest protect)
